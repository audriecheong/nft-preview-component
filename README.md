## My process

I started by writing down the HTML first to give this page a structure. Then Boostratp 4 was added shortly after. But most of the components was styled by using CSS.

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Bootstrap 4

### What I learned

Use this section to recap over some of your major learnings while working through this project. Writing these out and providing code samples of areas you want to highlight is a great way to reinforce your own knowledge.

To see how you can add code snippets, see below:

```html
<div class="col-6 price">
  <span class="eth"><img src="images/icon-ethereum.svg" alt="" id="eth-icon">&nbsp; 0.041 ETH</span>
</div>
```
```css
.card-image {
  background-color: hsl(178, 100%, 50%);
  background-image: url(images/icon-view.svg);
  background-size: 50px;
  background-repeat: no-repeat;
  background-position: center;
  border-radius: 10px;
}

.card-img-top:hover {
  height: 100%;
  width: 100%;
  opacity: 60%;
  transition: .5s ease;
}
```

### Continued development

I found it hard to change the color of the icon while it's on a hover state.

### Useful resources

- [w3school](https://www.w3schools.com/howto/howto_css_image_overlay.asp) - This is an amazing article which helped me finally understand XYZ. I'd recommend it to anyone still learning this concept.
